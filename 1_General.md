# General

## Goals

This handbook has the following aims and guiding principles:

*	Increase readability and maintainability with a unified style.
*	Minimize complexity with proven design principles
*	Increase code safety and prevent hard-to-find errors through best practices.
*	Maximize effectiveness of coding tools.
* Accommodate IDE- or framework-generated code.
* Provide justifications and examples for rules.

The style and formatting guidelines draw mostly from in-house programming experience, but also include ideas from Microsoft’s C# coding style [1, 2], and benefits from both the IDesign [3] and Philips [4] coding styles.

## Scope

This handbook includes:

* General programming advice and best practices
* General formatting and style recommendations
* C#-specific sections
* Encodo-specific sections
* Library-specific sections (e.g. for Quino)

The assumed environment is:

* _Microsoft Visual Studio 2015_ or newer
* C# 6.0 or newer

For older versions of Visual Studio, use what you can or refer to older versions of this handbook.

## Fixing Problems in the Handbook

This document is a work-in-progress. Please speak up or contribute if you think there is something missing.

*	If a guideline is not sufficiently clear, recommend a clearer formulation.
*	If you don’t like a guideline, try to get it changed or removed, but don’t just ignore it. Your code reviewer is most likely unaware that you are special and not subject to the rules.

## Applying the Guidelines

* Unless otherwise noted, these guidelines are not optional, nor are they up to interpretation.
*	A reviewer always has the right to correct mistakes and aberrations, but is not obligated to do so in every review.
*	Please note issues with the guidelines during a review. These ad-hoc changes should flow into the guidelines if enough parties agree.

The handbook defines the goal. Use iterations and refactoring to incrementally bring the code closer to full compliance.

## Fixing Problems in Code

Fix non-conforming code at the earliest opportunity.

*	Fix small and localized errors immediately, in a "cleanup" commit.
*	Always use a separate commit to rename or move files.
*	Create an issue for larger problems that cannot be fixed quickly.

## Working with an IDE

Modern IDEs generate code; this is very helpful and saves a lot of work. Turn a blind eye to style infractions in generated code.

*	Configure your IDE to produce code that is as close to the guidelines as possible.
*	Update names for visual-design elements and event handlers manually, if needed.
*	Write code generators to produce conforming code.
*	Do not update code generated by tools not under your control (e.g. *.Designer files).
*	Use “Format Document” to reformat auto-generated code.
*	Use the highest warning level available (level 4 in Visual Studio) and address all warnings (either by fixing the code or explicitly ignoring them).
