# Patterns & Best Practices


## Using Generics

* Use generic collection types (e.g. use `IList<T>` instead of `IList`).
* Declare generic constraints instead of casting or using the `is`-operator.
* Generic constraints should operate on interfaces wherever possible.
* When inheriting from both a generic and non-generic interface (e.g. `IEnumerable` and `IEnumerable<T>`), implement the non-generic version explicitly and implement it using the generic interface.


## Defining Extension Methods

* Do not extend `object` or `string` in commonly used namespaces.
* Use extension methods to extend system or third-party library types.
* Do not mix extension methods with other static methods. If a class contains extension methods, it should contain only extension methods and private support methods.

### Interface Design

* Use extension methods for methods that can be defined in terms of public members of that interface.
* Do so only for methods for which the implementation is certain to be the same for all implementations. That is, do not restrict an implementationâ€™s efficiency because an extension instead of interface method was used.
* Define useful, but more rarely used extension methods in a separate namespace to force callers to "opt in".
* Do not mix extension methods for different types in one class.
* Do not _make decisions_ in extension methods. Instead, declare components and inject them where needed.
* Do not use static code that does _make decisions_ in extension methods.
* Do not use a global service locator in extension methods.
* Do not pass an IOC to extension methods.

## Generated code

* Use partial classes for generated code wherever possible.
* Do not commit manual changes to generated code. Temporary changes for debugging are fine, but always be aware that your changes will be overwritten when code is re-generated.

## Setting Timeouts

* Use `TimeSpans` to encapsulate timeout values.
* Prefer passing the timeout value as a parameter to the method that will use it rather than offering it as a property on the class. This more closely associates the timeout value with the operation that uses it.
* The method can decide which values of `TimeSpan` are valid (including `TimeSpan.Zero` and `TimeSpan.MaxValue`).

## Configuration & File System

* An assembly should not assume its location.
* Do not use the registry to store application information; save user settings to a user-accessible file instead.

## Logging and Tracing

* Do not log directly to any output (e.g. a file or the console).
* Avoid logging directly to global or static constructs.
* Instead, inject an interface into the method where needed (e.g. `ILogger`).
